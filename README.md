## About me

2023 Makers bootcamp graduate with experience in building full-stack web and mobile apps using a variety of technologies including React, JavaScript and Ruby. An effective team worker with a high EQ, excellent problem-solving skills, and the ability to learn quickly and independently.

I have a strong educational background, holding a bachelor’s in business (first) and a master’s in Chinese studies (distinction). In addition to these, I was awarded two government scholarships to study Mandarin to an advanced level in Taiwan. I’ve also worked in a number of charity sector roles, experiences that allowed me to hone my communication, teamwork and project management skills which have served me well throughout my coding journey. In my spare time, I enjoy making music which requires innovative thinking in order to produce unique and noteworthy songs. This flair for creativity has proven useful throughout the development process, such as when solving problems and coming up with ideas for apps.

Having greatly enjoyed learning spoken languages, last year I decided to give programming languages a try. I was hooked from the first day and before long I was accepted onto the Makers bootcamp. Now that I’ve graduated, I can’t wait to make full use of the diverse array of skills I’ve acquired over the years in my first role as a junior developer!

## Hobbies

#### Music
One of my greatest passions is music. I love all things music and enjoy making sample-based songs inspired by '90s hip hop using the digital audio workstation FL Studio. My favourite genres include hip-hop, jazz and electronic.

#### Learning languages and travelling
I've learned Mandarin to an advanced level which included two year-long stints in Taiwan (the first in Taipei and the second in Hualien). I also recently started learning French and can't wait to take some holidays in the Francophone world in the next few years!

#### Sport
I love to exercise regularly. I run most days and like to swim and hike when I get the chance. I also enjoy team sports - I played football throughout my childhood and more recently was on the softball team during my time at St Mungo's.
